🎓 Study Time vs Final Grades: Insights from Data Analysis 📊

Hi everyone! I’m excited to share my latest data analysis project, where I explored the relationship between study time and academic performance using the "Student Performance" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

🔍 Key Findings:
A weak positive relationship exists between study time and final grades (G3).
While each additional study category predicts a ~0.534-point increase in grades, study time alone accounts for only 1% of the variance in performance.
This suggests that academic success is influenced by many factors beyond just study hours.
📈 Methods Used:
EDA to understand distributions and trends.
Linear regression modeling for predictive analysis.
Visualization tools (Python, matplotlib, seaborn) to present insights effectively.

🚀 Takeaways:
This project reaffirmed the importance of looking at the bigger picture when analyzing academic performance. Factors like sleep, participation, and extracurriculars could be pivotal and warrant further exploration.
